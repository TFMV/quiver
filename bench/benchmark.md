# Quiver Performance Benchmark Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Quiver vector database performance based on profiling and benchmarking data. The analysis focuses on CPU usage, memory allocation patterns, and operation performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

## CPU Profile Analysis

The CPU profile reveals that the most significant performance bottlenecks are in vector similarity calculations and HNSW graph operations:

| Function | CPU Time | % of Total | Cumulative |
|----------|----------|------------|------------|
| github.com/viterin/vek/internal/functions.CosineSimilarity_Go_F32 | 6.12s | 42.24% | 42.24% |
| runtime.madvise | 1.72s | 11.87% | 54.11% |
| runtime.cgocall | 1.26s | 8.70% | 62.80% |
| github.com/coder/hnsw.(*layerNode).addNeighbor | 0.47s | 3.24% | 66.05% |
| internal/runtime/maps.(*Iter).Next | 0.43s | 2.97% | 69.01% |

### Key Observations

1. **Vector Similarity Calculations**: The `CosineSimilarity_Go_F32` function from the viterin/vek package consumes over 42% of CPU time, making it the primary performance bottleneck.

2. **Memory Management**: System calls like `madvise` and `cgocall` consume about 20% of CPU time, indicating significant overhead in memory management.

3. **HNSW Graph Operations**: The HNSW graph operations, particularly `addNeighbor` and `search`, are significant contributors to CPU usage, especially when considering their cumulative impact.

4. **Batch Processing**: The `flushBatch` method has a high cumulative CPU usage (70.39%), suggesting it's a critical path for optimization.

## Memory Profile Analysis

The memory profile shows the following allocation patterns:

| Function | Memory Allocated | % of Total | Cumulative |
|----------|------------------|------------|------------|
| github.com/coder/hnsw.(*layerNode).search | 744.30MB | 43.33% | 43.33% |
| github.com/coder/hnsw/heap.(*Heap).Push | 257.00MB | 14.96% | 58.29% |
| golang.org/x/exp/maps.Keys | 113.01MB | 6.58% | 64.86% |
| github.com/coder/hnsw/heap.(*innerHeap).Push | 93.06MB | 5.42% | 70.28% |
| github.com/coder/hnsw.(*layerNode).addNeighbor | 73.54MB | 4.28% | 74.56% |

### Key Observations

1. **Search Operations**: The HNSW graph search operation is the largest memory consumer, accounting for over 43% of all allocations.

2. **Heap Operations**: The heap data structure used in HNSW consumes significant memory, with heap push operations accounting for nearly 15% of allocations.

3. **Map Operations**: The `maps.Keys` function is responsible for 6.58% of memory allocations, suggesting frequent map key extractions.

4. **Vector Generation**: The `generateRandomVector` function allocates 46.02MB (2.68%), indicating potential optimization opportunities in test/benchmark code.
