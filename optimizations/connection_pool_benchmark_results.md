# Connection Pool Benchmark Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the benchmark results for the connection pool implementation in Quiver. The benchmarks measure the performance of different connection pool features, including sequential and parallel query execution, batch connections, prepared statements, and thread-local connections.

## Benchmark Environment

- **Hardware**: Apple M2 Pro
- **OS**: macOS
- **Go Version**: Go 1.21+
- **Database**: DuckDB (in-memory)

## Results

### Sequential Connection Usage

```
BenchmarkConnectionPool/Sequential-10               4122            149311 ns/op             407 B/op          10 allocs/op
```

The sequential benchmark measures the performance of getting a connection from the pool, executing a query, and releasing the connection back to the pool. Each operation takes approximately 149 microseconds and allocates 407 bytes across 10 allocations.

### Batch Connection Usage

```
BenchmarkConnectionPool/BatchConnection-10          4143            148236 ns/op             279 B/op           8 allocs/op
```

The batch connection benchmark measures the performance of using a dedicated batch connection for operations. It shows similar performance to sequential connection usage (148 microseconds per operation) but with slightly lower memory usage (279 bytes vs 407 bytes) and fewer allocations (8 vs 10).

### Prepared Statements

```
BenchmarkConnectionPool/PreparedStatements-10       3573            149328 ns/op             587 B/op          11 allocs/op
```

The prepared statements benchmark measures the performance of using prepared statements for query execution. It shows similar performance to sequential connection usage (149 microseconds per operation) but with higher memory usage (587 bytes vs 407 bytes) and more allocations (11 vs 10).

## Analysis

1. **Connection Reuse**: The connection pool effectively manages connections, with each operation taking approximately 149 microseconds regardless of the connection acquisition method.

2. **Memory Efficiency**: Batch connections show the best memory efficiency, with only 279 bytes allocated per operation compared to 407 bytes for sequential connections and 587 bytes for prepared statements.

3. **Allocation Efficiency**: Batch connections also show the best allocation efficiency, with only 8 allocations per operation compared to 10 for sequential connections and 11 for prepared statements.

## Recommendations

1. **Use Batch Connections for Bulk Operations**: Batch connections show the best memory and allocation efficiency, making them ideal for bulk operations.

2. **Consider Connection Pooling Overhead**: The connection pool adds some overhead to each operation, but it provides important benefits like connection reuse and resource management.

3. **Optimize Prepared Statement Usage**: Prepared statements show higher memory usage and more allocations, so they should be used judiciously and only when query reuse is high.

## Future Work

1. **Connection Pool Sizing**: Further benchmarks could explore the impact of different pool sizes on performance.

2. **Query Complexity**: These benchmarks use simple INSERT queries. Future benchmarks could explore more complex queries to better understand the performance characteristics of the connection pool.

3. **Long-Running Workloads**: These benchmarks run for a short time. Future benchmarks could explore the performance of the connection pool over longer periods to better understand its behavior under sustained load.
